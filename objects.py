The window is at your eye level.",		2:"You are plummeting to your death.",		3:"You appear to be in a gigantic waste paper basket. Above, you can see ten floors circling the empty cylinder with you at the bottom. Looking straight up, you can see the sky that you fell from, and nothing but clouds in it. There is a staircase here which starts underneath the paper, and rises, turning, onto the first floor.",		4:"The floor hangs over the mountain of paper like a long balcony in the shape of a ring, four or five meters from outer to inner rim. Around it, hundreds of people mill around looking at and, it appears, interacting with, posters that stretch in a row around the circular wall to form a complete ring around the circumference of the floor. You can go Clockwise or Widdershins.",		5:"There is a small break in the otherwise unbroken line of posters here, occupied by a small bald man sitting at a desk.",		6:"There is another break in the row of posters here where a staircase leads upstairs.",		7:"Among the bustling crowd, there is a man here dressed as a pirate.",		8:"You are standing at the West end of a boardwalk. Around you, everyone is dressed as some approximation of naval thief and vagabond. You see through the wall of ships, as close and tightly crowded as the buildings that line the south end of the street, that you are in a bay facing the ocean. Ships drift in and out of the harbor glut from an unseen distance. To your south is a tavern, throughout which float drunks as numerous as the ships.",		9:"The crowd is thickest here. A more modern-looking ship than the rest is moored to the north. To the south is a door with something pinned to it.",		10:"The boardwalk is wider here than anywhere else. To the south is a bustling market.",		11:"You are at the east end of the boardwalk. To the north, a wooden ship has a porthole window missing where it is moored to the dock. Opposite it is the last building on the boardwalk. The building seems to have an antenna on its roof.",		12:"A man sits in front of a wardrobe-sized radio transmitter in the corner. There is a table in the middle of the room with a single chair at it, and a hammock hung in a corner.",		13:"You are at a marketplace, where the stalls are packed so close together that the hawkers are trapped behind them until the end of the day.",		14:"The sounds of the tavern engulf you as much as the customers. An old drunk naps with his head across from you on the table. Opposite the door, the bar itself is as a battlefield: the bartender fighting off hordes of pirates, rum and beer his ammunition.",		15:"The hull is a mess of ropes and nets. There is an anchor in the corner, and a chest next to you. A wooden staircase leads upstairs through a trap door.",		16:"You see nothing. It is so dark that the darkness seems viscous and opaque around you.",		16.1:"You have no elbow room in this relatively spacious room. It is a small warehouse of posters, toys, props and countless more forms of assorted memorabilia.",		17:"One side of the room consists of a floor-to-ceiling window. Two luxuriant sofas sit by the glass facing out onto the empty field next to the door you came out of. There is a refreshment cart at the back, next to a second door door. The floor is covered in velvety gray carpet.",		18:"You are in a curved corridor, lit by fluorescent lamps overhead. The corridor curves away from you as if an arc is a circle hundreds of meters in circumference.",		19:"The room is a shrine to television. One wall is covered completely by a collection of hundreds of DVDs, the other almost completely by a television. The man who knocked you out is sitting on a chair in the exact center of the room, watching Firefly.",		20:"You are at the end of the hallway. You can see onto the field through the fiberglass that forms the inner wall of the hallway and the outer rim of the grassy field. The door to the room you woke up in is here, and next to you,  ending the corridor is a cage full of cameras, microphones, and other apparatus.",		21:"There is a fuse-box here, but one fuse is missing.

Florescent lights flicker on overhead just as a cloud covers the faint sun. A sound like radio static fills the air.			The skinny man walks out from his room, and walks toward you.	"I suppose I should explain what's going on." He says.	"That would be super."	"I'm sorry that you had to come in to all of this. The truth is that the story's over, you were only here for the end. It must not make much sense."	"How much do you know about me?" You ask.	"Not much, and what I do know are just guesses. When I saw you at the bay, you looked so much more aware than everyone else, as if you had never been subjected to the power before." He pauses. "For some reason, a few of use can have a... narcotic effect on people. When we talked, people became enthralled. They were absorbed by us. Of course we loved it, people would treat us like we were so attractive and charismatic. Only, not so long ago, it started to break down. We started to find each other, those of us that had the power, and we began to form groups. People would spend all day listening to us talk in turns... and they started moving on to more and more mesmerizing groups. We didn't mind at first, in fact we loved it. We were treated as kings. It became the only major leisure activity. After some time, many of us started letting the power get to us. The groups started coming together, combining. We started designing a way for us to reach everyone. We started putting more and more of ourselves into the project. It was a way for us to combine all of our talk. Almost a way to combine all of ourselves. We made a great structure which would provide people with as much talk as they wanted, and we got together to organize it and power it. People loved it, so we let it grow. We discovered that each person could power it a little bit, by answering questions and doing calculations. We didn't know that the structure itself was getting smarter. Nobody believed they were losing control of it. In fact, they still don't. It started to assimilate anything with any power, but there was nothing as powerful as people's minds. They didn't even know they were powering it, but everything they processed was fed into its neural networks, growing it and powering it. Until it achieves sentience, it relies on them and their processing power. After that, god knows."	You stall, trying to work this out. Processing power or not, your brain has a hard time understanding him. "So..., where is it? What does it look like?" You ask.	He points up. "You were out for less than an hour" He says, "In that time, it took everyone you saw outside."	You look up. "It just looks like an ordinary cloud." You say.	"It's dangerous that way," he says, more grave than before, "But right now there are untold masses of people up there. Each crammed into their own little room. Holding it up, making it smarter. The only reason we're both still here is the static and the glass. If you can't hear it, you can't be drawn in. Or in my case, if it can't hear me."	"Why does it matter if it can hear you?" You ask, fighting not to sink into his words like giant cushions.	"I'm the only one left that has the power and isn't up there living like a king, trying not to think about the day that it doesn't need me any more. It has a way of sensing us that the static disrupts. That's why I had to send you out. This must be very confusing for you, coming in just at the end, very sudden. I hope you weren't too distressed."	"Well, I kept my head." You say, glancing around at all four walls. "Is there any way I can get back home?"	"As far as I know, it was that thing that brought you here." He says, "And as long as it's here, you will be too. All we can do now is wait for it to pass."		You stand awkwardly quiet for a minute, before he walks down the hall to the announcer's booth.'''		}		intros = {		1:"You are in a mostly empty room.",		1.1:"You heave the sack up, and pour the contents onto the floor forming the remains of the world's largest house of cards.

The edge of the table now perfectly underlines the screen.",		1.3:"With an embarrassing amount of effort, you manage to heave yourself onto the table. The room seems smaller from up here. The window is at your eye level.",		2:"With much grunting and flailing, you manage to flop out of the window. For a second you tumble weightless and disoriented. You look around. You appear to be at least five kilometers above the ground with nothing but empty sky around you. Below you a huge hexagonal building is eager to make your acquaintance. For lack of a feasible alternative, you fall.",		3:"You grab both ends of the sack and let it catch and fill with air. As it slows your fall, you notice you have been screaming. You stop. You look around. The building sorta looks like the pentagon, you think to yourself, but like, less pentagonal. You notice great masses of tents and huts and small houses separated by forests and lakes surrounding the building. In the distance you see an immensely long golden wall like a snake that lies across the landscape, its head and tail disappearing over the horizon. You imagine you can see red buildings behind it. Before you can admire the scenery more closely you fall into the building, far from its center. You brace yourself, and fall into a large circular opening. Your fall is broken by a pile of paper many meters high.",		4:"You walk up the stairs, and onto the first floor",		5:"There is a small break in the otherwise unbroken line of posters here, occupied by a small bald man sitting at a desk.",		6:"There is another break in the row of posters here where a staircase leads upstairs.",		7:"Through the crowd here, you see a man standing by the railing looking out upon the island of paper rising out of the ocean of paper. He is unremarkable but for his pegleg and parrot. And eyepatch. And pirate hat.",		8:"Suddenly reality (or, you imagine, an inexperienced impostor) decides to present itself again. You are standing on a boardwalk. The wooden ships on the waterfront are packed so thick that for a moment you saw nothing but and ordinary street. The sun sits over one end of it, which you decide to be East.",		9:"To the north, a unique ship is moored to shore. It gives the impression of a wooden yacht, upon which a well-dressed group of pirates chatter happily and sip rum from old fashioned glasses. To your south is a door with a sheet of paper pinned to it.",		10:"Pushing on through the crowd, you reach a place where the boardwalk thickens. To your south the bars and taverns stop and are replaced by what looks like a fish market, where dozens of men stand at their stalls and hawk.",		11:"You reach the east end of the boardwalk. To the north, a wooden ship has a porthole window missing where it is moored to the dock. Opposite it is the last building on the boardwalk. The building seems to have an antenna on its roof.",		12:"You enter a room with a desk-sized marine radio taking up half a wall. An older, bigger, harder-looking pirate than those outside sits at the radio, fiddling with dials.\n\t\"Can ya believe tha gall?\" He asks.\n\t\"I-I'm sorry,\" You stutter, \"I can leave.\"\n\t\"But I don't mean ya, matey. I mean that rotten scallywag out yonder.\" He gestures out the door, \"Moors right outside o' me house, and after what he did to me. I'd be ashamed to call meself a pirate.\"\n\tHe continues to seethe, then abruptly looks up at you as if you walked in that second.\n\t\"I'm sorry, matey, whar's me manners?\" He asks, considerably more cheerfully, \"Did ya want somethin'?\"\n\t\"I wonder,\" You ask without much hope, \"What this thing is... this thing that's... happening?\" You pause, unsure of the breadth of your intended question.\n\t\"I'll tell ya what's happenin', matey,\" Starts the pirate promisingly, \"Tha' rotten lilly-livered fuck kicked me out o' th' group, and changed all th' keys.\"\n\tYou sigh.\n\t\"Tell ya what, matey.\" He says, \"If ya brin' me one o' the'r old keys, I'll teach them sons o' scurvy a lesson.\"\n\tYou assent as he returns to his radio and grumbling.",		13:"You are at a small but extremely crowded bustling little marketplace.",		14:"You push your way into the crowded tavern, and sit down at the only free seat. In front of you is an old drunk asleep with his head on the table.\n\n\t\"mmblp,\" Says the old man, \"couldusesomeliquorthar,\" he manages. You catch an empty glass rolling off the table.

Above you, two men are talking.\n\t\"...and it'd be fine if we had somethin' new,\" Says the one.\n\t\"I tell you thar's nothin'. All tha channels ar' done fer tha season. If thar's ever more I'll be th' first one t'set sail.\" Replies the other.",		16:"You clamber into the hull again, but as soon as your feet hit wood, you begin to drift away from shore.

Ah, you think, depth perception. No eyepatch then. You stand up to find that your hat, too, is gone. You are in a white room. Behind you, one side is entirely covered by a wall-to-wall dvd collection. A huge TV spans the wall in front of you. It is much larger than the door. In the middle of the room, towards the television, is a large armchair faced away from you. Someone is sat in it, watching TV. Your backpack is next to you, missing only the flashlight used to bludgeon you.",		20:"You exit the room to find that you have come out of one of half a dozen doors around a hallway that arcs around one end of a stadium, facing into a field. It is the same field that you saw from the box before, but now the stands are empty. A plexiglass wall is in front of you, and it follows the hallway around, bordering the field. At the end of the hallway clockwise (To your left, as you face onto the field) is an announcer's booth. Widdershins is a locked cage filled with broadcasting equipment.",		21:"There is a fuse-box here, but one fuse is missing.
