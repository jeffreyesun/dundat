Hello. If I knew you would make it this far, I would have cleaned up a bit. Anyway, picture this:
Someone sends you a link, says "This is cool stuff, Andy!" (That's right, I know your name, Andrew.)
You click it, and get to a webpage. All is black, but there is some green text in the center, and a text-entry below it.
