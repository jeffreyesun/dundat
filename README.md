# dundat
A text-based adventure game

This isn't hosted anywhere at the moment, but here's what you should imagine when you play! Picture this:
Someone sends you a link, says "This is cool stuff, Andy!" (That's right. I know your name, Andrew.)
You click it, and get to a webpage. All is black, but there is some green text in the center, and a text-entry below it, reading:

>You arrive at a suspicious website, with a boldly self-referential prompt. What do you do?

>&gt;&gt;

# How to Play
Clone the repository, and run dundat.py in a terminal.
